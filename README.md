I utilized NumPy and Pandas to efficiently clean, manipulate, and analyze data for model training. Once cleared, I built a logistic regression model with an accuracy of 86.80% and a neural network model with an accuracy of 87.10% using SciKit. Lastly, I visualized model performance and correlations through scatter plots using Matplotlib to interpret predictive trends.
